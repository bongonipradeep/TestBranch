1.Which vesion did you use PEGA RPA

2.Different adapters you have used

Windows,Web,Text,

3.Have you used Universal web adapter

4.how comforatble with java script,In universl webadapter perform click won't happen in that case how to handle with Java Script

explain how to inplement custom javascript and call from pega rotics(Execute script invoke method)
5.how to call third party components from Pega robotics(using dll,place in pogo robotcs studio)

6.There are 2 projects in my solution how to call one project from other project(Using entry ponint of project)

7.Have you used interaction manager(we can take user inputs in multiple projects,any avtivities)

The Interaction Manager component connects all projects and customer interactions through the XML file by accessing the XML through their properties, events, and methods in the Object 
Explorer. The Interaction Manager maintains a direct link to the contents of the interaction configuration file and stores the context values to share them across projects and to 
complete interaction. These context values appear as the Interaction Manager properties in the Object Explorer. When developing a solution, the Interaction Manager must be the first 
framework component added to the Global Container for each project.

8.Have you used Robot Manager(there )(Basically we have the runtime config and common config we will pass pr web URL which will enabe PEGA robot manager we will use
automation deployments using RPA Services)

9.There is one RPA which read objects from Robot manager if i asked to configure RPA what are the steps(RPA should connect to Robot Manager){using com
man config file mention,credentials,Authorizatio}

10.In robot manager differnet ques are there how will you  tell  bot to connect particular que(Woek baskets,where wil you configure work basket Name in the pEGA end.)

11.I am running some RPA exception occurs then bot should log all the information user id,all the details need to capture in to Database how will do that
how to get computer name and user id,HOW R U GOING TO RETRIVE COMPUTER NAME IN PEGA ROBOTICS(Envoronmnetal variables,like in the toll box we can add)

12.Do you know how to call webservice from PEGA or Web API(REST Client component,serivec client)

13.IF you want to run some expernal EXE from c# how r u going to implement(using executable path),how we invoke third party application()

14.how to VB script from c# 

15.How can we connect Database from PEGA robotics(sql coomand,sql query)

16.while Table readinb in HTML in I.E we pass index how to go in universal Webadapter()

17.How r u going to interagate main frame table

Message Manger

This innovation lets you share message strings across multiple projects. You can also define the characteristics of a message dialog 

that can be displayed to Robot Runtime/Agile Desktop users.

Excel interop services using c# script

PDF connector or component(structure data ,unstructure data )

run time logs(audit and Error logs)

run time config(App data folder)

hook child process


coming to the project,Nomura around 20 process 
RPA and RDA used pega robotics 

soluton design - whole requirment Flow,environment details,config paths,requied urls every information required for the prject development we 
include in solution design.

Nomura is a global financial services group service the needs of individuals, institutions, corporates and governments through our three business 
divisions: Retail, Wholesale (Global Markets and Investment Banking) and Investment Management.

RPA and RDA i involed in RPA bot developemnt using PEGA Robot manager,basicallu user pushing the cases once case created automatically bot will start the 
process all webapplications using chrome browser validating data based on validations docs will be available they wil be download which are odf docs
